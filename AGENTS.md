## Source Code Reference

Source code for dependencies is available in `opensrc/` for deeper understanding of implementation details.

See `opensrc/sources.json` for the list of available packages and their versions.

Use this source code when you need to understand how a package works internally, not just its types/interface.

### Fetching Additional Source Code

To fetch source code for a package or repository you need to understand, run:

```bash
npx opensrc <package>           # npm package (e.g., npx opensrc zod)
npx opensrc pypi:<package>      # Python package (e.g., npx opensrc pypi:requests)
npx opensrc crates:<package>    # Rust crate (e.g., npx opensrc crates:serde)
npx opensrc <owner>/<repo>      # GitHub repo (e.g., npx opensrc vercel/ai)
```

## llms-full reference

When working on tasks about a library/framework/runtime/platform, first consult
`llms-furl/`, which contains llms-full.txt split into a tree of leaves — small,
searchable files for quick lookup.

Workflow:
1. Check domains in `llms-furl/AGENTS.md`.
2. Search within the relevant domain (e.g. `rg -n "keyword" llms-furl/bun.sh`).
3. If needed, navigate with `index.json` using `jq`.
4. If no relevant info is found, state that and then move on to other sources.
